jSona is a configuration file(JSON), [vlcj](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) and [JavaFx](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/index.html) based music and media player. The aim of jSona is to always keep your playlists in synch with your music folders. For fast fulltext search jSona uses [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/). The follwing features are fully supported:

  - Supports all common media formats that VLC [supports](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_Features_Formats/)
  - Load artist informations and images via [last.fm](http://www.lastfm.de/api) and [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/)
  - Include your music foldersf
  - Create multiple playlists
  - Fulltext search

##Configuration file / config.json

Here is an example of the default configuration file. You have to setup your **VLC path** correctly. If you use Java 32-bit/64-bit you also have to use VLC-32-bit/64-bit.
```json
{
  "PATH_TO_VLCJ": "D:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC",
  "MAX_SEARCH_RESULT_AMOUNT": 512,
  "VOLUME": 100,
  "FOLDERS": [
    "D:/media/music",
    "C:/share",
    "C:/downloads/music",
    "\\nas\share\music"
  ],
  "PLAYBACK_MODE": "NORMAL",
  "RECENTLY_ADDED_UNITL_TIME_IN_DAYS": -7,
  "THEME": "grey",
  "KEY_SKIP_TIME": 10,
  "WINDOW_UNDECORATED": true,
  "TITLE": "jSona - open source project by Frank Roth",
  "MIN_HEIGHT": 600,
  "MIN_WIDTH": 720,
  "COLORIZE_ITEMS": true,
  "SCANNER_AND_TAGGER_LOGGING_GRANULARITY": 128
}
```

And here an explanation of all possible attributes:

###PATH_TO_VLCJ
Path to your VLC root directory where the libvlc or libvlccore library is. (In windows the files are called libvlc.dll and libvlccore.dll).

###MAX_SEARCH_RESULT_AMOUNT
Maximum search results of the lucene engine (smaller is faster)

###VOLUME
Default startup volume. Will be overwritten by jSona (always save the recently changed volume).

###FOLDERS
Your music folders. Care of JSON-Syntax and correct backslashes (/). jSona also supports the usage of the Uniform Naming Convention and folders in a network (e.g.: "\\\\servername\folder\path"). See example above... 

###PLAYBACK_MODE
Playbackmode of jSona. Choose one of them: {NORMAL, SHUFFLE}. Will be overwritten by jSona (always save the recently changed playback mode).

###RECENTLY_ADDED_UNITL_TIME_IN_DAYS
How long do you want to show new songs in the "New" tab. If you choose -7 then new songs will be displayed for one week in the "New" tab. This number should always be negative.

###THEME
Currently there is only one theme available: {"grey"}.

###KEY_SKIP_TIME
If you change the duration slider with the help of the arrow keys(left or right) the slider rewind or skips 10 seconds.

###WINDOW_UNDECORATED
If you set the value on **false** the normal OS look and feel will be used. If you set the value on **true** [in-sideFX Undecorator](https://github.com/in-sideFX/Undecorator) will be used to make the jSona window beautiful.

![jSona screenshot - undecorated: false](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3669658/github/jSona/jsona_undecorated_2.png "undecorated: false")

###TITLE
Window title of jSona. Will only be displayed if the **WINDOW_UNDECORATED** property is set to **false**.

### MIN_HEIGHT
Minimum window height.

### MIN_WIDTH
Minimum window width.

###COLORIZE_ITEMS
If the value is set to **true** the same music items will be displayed with a different smooth background color. If the value is set to **false** then the default JavaFX list background will be used (see screenshot above).

###FILEPATH_BASED_MUSIC_INFORMATIONS
There is the possibility to define rules to detect music informations with the help of the file path. Currently there are two kind of rules {"ROOT_SUBFOLDER_LEVEL_RULE", "FILENAME_RULE"}. The "ROOT_SUBFOLDER_LEVEL_RULE" is a rule based on the subfolder level according to the root directory. With the help of the "FILENAME_RULE" you can match everything according to the filename (not file path) of the file. It is possible to ignore file endings and to replace underscores with a space.

The follwing examples should help you with to use these rules.

If you have a folder structure like this and this is your music file name:
```
C:\media\music\Rock\ACDC\Highway to Hell\03 - Walk All Over You.mp3
```

Your root folder is
```
C:\media\music
```

With the follwing rules you can match the genre (%GENRE%), the artist (%ARTIST%), the title (%TITLE%), the album (%ALBUM%) and the track number (%TRACK_NO%):
```json
{

...

"FILEPATH_BASED_MUSIC_INFORMATIONS": [
    {
      "rule": "ROOT_SUBFOLDER_LEVEL_RULE",
      "params": {
        "PATTERN": "%GENRE%",
        "REPLACE_UNDERSCORES_WITH_SPACES": false,
        "FOLDER_LEVEL": 1
      }
    },
    {
      "rule": "ROOT_SUBFOLDER_LEVEL_RULE",
      "params": {
        "PATTERN": "%ARTIST%",
        "REPLACE_UNDERSCORES_WITH_SPACES": false,
        "FOLDER_LEVEL": 2
      }
    } 
  {
      "rule": "ROOT_SUBFOLDER_LEVEL_RULE",
      "params": {
        "PATTERN": "%ALBUM%",
        "REPLACE_UNDERSCORES_WITH_SPACES": false,
        "FOLDER_LEVEL": 3
      }
    }    
    {
      "rule": "FILENAME_RULE",
      "params": {
        "PATTERN": "%TRACK_NO% - %TITLE%",
        "IGNORE_FILE_ENDING": true,
        "REPLACE_UNDERSCORES_WITH_SPACES": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Every matching **%VARIABLE%** will be trimmed at the ending, so it does not mather if you choose **%TRACK_NO% - %TITLE%** or **%TRACK_NO%-%TITLE%** as a pattern. It is also possible to ignore areas in the path by producing non declared Variables like: %TMP%, %I_DONT_NEED_THAT%, %IGNORE%... you can create anything...

###SCANNER_AND_TAGGER_LOGGING_GRANULARITY
Logging every file in the scanner and tagging process can be very time expensive. Because of that you can define the granularity of the scanner and tagging logging. If the value is set to 1 every file is logged (time expensive). If the value is set to 128 only every 128th and the last file will be logged. This value can be every number > 0.

###HOTKEYS
Here is a list of all modifiers and keys that can be used: https://github.com/frankred/jSona/wiki/Key-Codes.
Currently only global hotkeys work. Supported application events are: {PLAYER_VOLUME_UP, PLAYER_VOLUME_DOWN, PLAYER_PLAY_PAUSE, VIEW_HIDE_SHOW}

```json
{

...

"HOTKEYS": [
    {
      "key": 107,
      "event": "PLAYER_VOLUME_UP",
      "global": true
    },
    {
      "key": 109,
      "event": "PLAYER_VOLUME_DOWN",
      "global": true
    },
    {
      "key": 19,
      "event": "PLAYER_PLAY_PAUSE",
      "global": true
    },
    {
      "key": 49,
      "modifiers": [
        128
      ],
      "event": "VIEW_HIDE_SHOW",
      "global": true
    }
  ],
}
```

##Changelog
###1.0.3
* Loading animation for each folder added in frontend.

###1.0.2
* HOTKEYS can now be defined in the config.json.
* VOLUME_UP_DOWN_AMOUNT amount for hotkeys can be defined in the config.json.

###1.0.1
* Music informations like artist or title can now be detected from the filepath with the help of detector rules in the config.json.
* Logging granularity of file scanner and tagger can now be defined in the config.json.

##Installation and Start
Download the current zip file and extract it. Then put in your correct VLC path into the config.json file and start jSona with the following command.
```
java -jar jSona-1.0.2.jar
```
jSona uses JavaFX so a current Java virtual machine with JavaFX support should be installed.
